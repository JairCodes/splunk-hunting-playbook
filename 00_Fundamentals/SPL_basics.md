## Search Syntax

**Definition:**<br>
The most fundamental aspect of SPL is searching. By default, a search returns all events, but it can be narrowed down with keywords <br>
boolean operators, comparison operators, and wildcard characters. For instance, a search for error would return all containing <br>
that word. <br>
The search command is typically implicit at the start of each SPL query and is not usually written out. However, here's an example using <br>
both explicit and implicit search syntax: <br>

```spl
# Implicit
index="main" ERROR

# Explicit
search index="main" ERROR
```

## Wildcards

**Definition:**<br>
Wildcards (*) can replace any number of characters in searches and field values <br>

### Syntax <br>
```spl
field="prefix*"     # matches any value that start with "prefix"
field="*suffix"     # matches any value that ends with "suffix"
field="*middle*"    # matches any value containing "middle"
```
### Example <br>
```spl
search index=main "*UNKOWN*"
```
**Retrieves** all events in the main index whose raw text contains the substring "UNKNOWN" anywhere in the event. <br>

## Fields and Comparison Operators

**Definition:**<br>
Splunk automatically identifies certain data as fields (like source, sourcetype, host, EventCode, etc.), and users can manually define additional fields. <br>
These fields can be used with comparison operators (=, !=, <, >, <=, >=) for more precise searches. <br>

### Example <br>
```spl
index="main" EventCode!=1
```
**Retrieves** the 'main' index for events that do not have an EventCode value of 1. <br>

## The fields command

**Definition:**<br>
The fields command specifies which fields should be included or excluded in the search results. <br>

### Example <br>
```spl
index="main" sourcetype="WinEventLog:Sysmon" EventCode=1
| fields - User
```
**Retrieving** all process creation events from the 'main' index, the fields command **excludes** the 'User' field from the search results. <br>
Thus, the results will contain all fields normally found in the Sysmon Event ID 1 logs, except for the user that initiated the process. <br>

## The table command

**Definition:**<br>
The **table** command presents search results in a tabular format. <br>

### Example <br>
```spl
index="main" sourcetype="WinEventLog:Sysmon" EventCode=1
| table _time, host, Image
```
This query **returns** process creation events, then arranges selected fields (_time, host, and Image) in a tabular format. _time is the <br>
timestamp of the event, host is the name of the host where the event occurred, and Image is the name of the executable file that <br>
represents the process. <br>

## The rename command

**Definition:**<br>
The **rename** command renames a field in the search results. <br>

### Example <br>
```spl
index="main" sourcetype="WinEventLog:Sysmon" EventCode=1
| rename Image as Process
```
This command **renames** the Image field to Process in the search results. Image field in Sysmon logs represents the name of the <br>
executable file for the process. By renaming it, all the subsequent references to Process would now refer to what was originally the <br>
Image field. <br>

## The dedup command

**Definition:**<br>
The 'dedup' command removes duplicate events. <br>

### Example <br>
```spl
index="main" sourcetype="WinLogEvent=Sysmon" EvenCode=1
| dedup Image
```
The dedup command removes duplicate entries based on the Image field from the process creation events. This means if the same <br>
process (Image) is created multiple times, it will appear only once in the results, effectively removing repetition. <br>

## The sort command

**Definition:**<br>
The **sort** command sorts the search results. <br>

### Example <br>
```spl
index="main" sourcetype="WinEventLog=Sysmon" EventCode=1
| sort - _time
```
This command sorts all process creation events in the main index in descending order of their timestamps (_time), i.e., the most recent <br>
events are shown first. <br>

## The stats command

**Definition:**<br>
The stats command performs statistical operations. <br>

### Example <br>
```spl
index="main" sourcetype="WinLogEvent=Sysmon" EvenCode=3
| stats count by _time, Image
```
**Retrieves** a table where each row represents a unique combination of a timestamp (_time) and a process (Image). The count <br>
column indicates the number of network connection events that occurred for that specific process at that specific time. <br>
